Ransomware_Imitation

=========================================================

Description:

"Ransomware_Imitation" imitates the Ransomware malware.

For convenience and demonstration, this program calls the 
server.exe program, which first loads the server, then calls 
the client function and initiates a connection between them.

The server sends the keys to the client, and then the client starts 
searching for files in the "RansomwareFilesArea" directory.

When the search is complete, the encryption file step begins.

For convenience and demonstration, it encrypts only .txt and .docx files.

The encrypted files created in folder "RansomwareFilesArea".

(*) The encryption code is taken from Microsoft site:
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa382358(v=vs.85).aspx
